<h2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The field of data analytics/science has grown significantly in recent years as a means to make sense of the vast amount of available data. It has permeated every aspect of computer science and engineering and is heavily involved in business decision-making. In the field of performance engineering, data analytics is for instance used for performance prediction and hence as an baseline instrument for controlling and improving the behaviour of a system.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Efficient and successful performance engineering depends on the definition of meaningful experiments, the choice of correct evaluation methodologies, the use of the correct algorithms, and also includes sophisticated data management. Only the combination of all these aspects leads to high reproducibility and reliable results.</p>

<h2><b>GOALS</b></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners from the domains of performance engineering, data analytics, data management, and system automation to foster the growth of an active community to advance the methods for automated performance engineering. We further seek to extend the number of available OpenAccess data sets of systems performance data.  </p>
    
<p >These domains include 
<ul>
<li><b>Modelling,</b></li>
<li><b>performance engineering,</b></li>
<li><b>data analytics,</b></li>
<li><b>data management,</b></li>
<li>and <b>system automation.</b></li>

</ul>
</p>
    
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, another goal is to extend the number of available OpenAccess data sets of systems performance data.</p>

<h2><b>WORKSHOP DATE</b></h2>

More information will be added soon.
